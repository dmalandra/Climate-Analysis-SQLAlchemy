# Hawaiian Vacation Analysis

I've decided to take a trip to Hawaii, but I'd like to do some climate analysis prior to making the trip.  I used Python and SQLAlchemy to do some basic analysis and data exploration of a database.  I specifically focused on temperature and precipitation data and visualized the data into a couple of charts using Matplotlib.

Finally, I designed a Flask API to query data related to temperature and precipitation data over the previous year.  This data will help me to nail down the ideal location in Hawaii that I'd like to visit.
